#### About the Organization

Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) works at the intersection of medicine, science, and law to secure justice and universal human rights for all.

#### Project Description

Since the beginning of the conflict in Syria, the ongoing assault on health care facilities and personnel has been a defining factor. As a strategy of war, it is effective. It is also illegal. PHR has systematically documented these war crimes since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011. In addition to documenting and mapping the attacks in real time, the intent of the project is to also create a post-conflict database for justice and accountability. 

Over the lifespan of the project, and through a rigorous verification and corroboration process, we've have documented almost 1,400 individual attacks made by at least 5 different attacking groups. The entire data entry process has been conducted remotely in New York by our team who work with a mixture of online and field sources.

#### KoBoToolbox's Role

We began using KoBoToolbox as our primary data collection tool for this project in 2018, and within a year of being implemented, KoBoToolbox has already proven to greatly simplify our existing data collection and reporting workflow. Before making the switch, PHR's data was divided into at least 10 different datasets, due to various people over the years working on the project and collecting data in different ways and formats.

We migrated and integrated all of our existing data into one unified dataset, which was then imported to KoBoToolbox. Having only one dataset has made it much easier for our team to reference and review all of our data, which has also naturally cleaned and standardized the data in the process. 

After the migration, all new data entries are being collected and added to the unified dataset using KoBoToolbox's web form. This not only has greatly simplified our work flow, data management, onboarding, and other aspects of the project, it has provided PHR with an easy framework and user interface to input complex and multi-layered data points.

After the initial data input from analysts, several PHR experts verify each attack report, adding comments to and changing its status as needed. This is done directly within the table view. From there, data is exported as needed for further analysisâ€”and to update the widely-used interactive map (see above).
